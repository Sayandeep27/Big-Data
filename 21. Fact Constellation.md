# Fact Constellation Schema in Big Data (Galaxy Schema)

---

## What is Fact Constellation?

**Fact Constellation** (also called **Galaxy Schema**) is a data warehouse design where **multiple fact tables share common dimension tables**.

In simple words:

> Instead of having only one fact table (like in Star Schema), we have **many fact tables connected to shared dimensions**.

This structure is used in **large organizations** where different business processes need to be analyzed together.

---

## Why is it Called "Constellation" or "Galaxy"?

Because:

* There are **multiple stars (fact tables)**
* All stars are connected through **shared dimensions**
* It looks like a **group of stars (galaxy)**

---

## Basic Idea

A **Fact Constellation Schema**:

* Contains **more than one fact table**
* Fact tables share **dimension tables**
* Used for **complex analytics**
* Supports **multiple business processes**

---

## Components of Fact Constellation

### 1. Fact Tables

Fact tables store **numerical measurable data**.

Examples:

* Sales Amount
* Quantity Sold
* Profit
* Discount

---

### 2. Dimension Tables

Dimension tables store **descriptive information**.

Examples:

* Time
* Product
* Customer
* Store
* Location

---

## Simple Real-Life Example (Retail Company)

A big retail company wants to analyze:

* Sales
* Inventory
* Shipping

Instead of one fact table, they create **three fact tables**.

---

## Example Structure

### Fact Tables

| Fact Table     | Measures                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Sales Fact     | Sales Amount, Quantity       |
| Inventory Fact | Stock Level                  |
| Shipping Fact  | Delivery Time, Shipping Cost |

---

### Shared Dimension Tables

| Dimension | Description                |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| Time      | Date, Month, Year          |
| Product   | Product ID, Name, Category |
| Store     | Store ID, Location         |
| Customer  | Customer ID, Segment       |

---

## How They Are Connected

```
          Time Dimension
               |
Product ---- Sales Fact ---- Store
   |              |
   |         Inventory Fact
   |              |
   |          Shipping Fact
   |
Customer Dimension
```

## Another Example (University System)

A university wants to analyze:

* Student Performance
* Attendance
* Fees

### Fact Tables

* Performance Fact
* Attendance Fact
* Fees Fact

### Shared Dimensions

* Student
* Course
* Time
* Department

This helps management see:

* Attendance vs Performance
* Fees vs Course
* Department-wise analysis

## Fact Constellation vs Star Schema

| Feature               | Star Schema             | Fact Constellation          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Number of Fact Tables | One                     | Multiple                    |
| Complexity            | Simple                  | Complex                     |
| Use Case              | Single business process | Multiple business processes |
| Scalability           | Medium                  | High                        |
| Data Size             | Smaller                 | Very Large                  |

## When Do We Use Fact Constellation?

Use it when:

* Organization is **large**
* There are **multiple departments**
* Need **combined analytics**
* Data is **huge (Big Data environments)**

Examples:

* Amazon
* Flipkart
* Banking Systems
* Telecom Companies

---

## Advantages

* Supports multiple business processes
* Reduces data redundancy by sharing dimensions
* Enables complex analytics
* Highly scalable
* Better for enterprise-level data warehouses

---

## Disadvantages

* Complex design
* Difficult to understand for beginners
* More joins required
* Query performance can be slower if not optimized

---

## Key Interview Definition (2–3 Lines)

**Fact Constellation Schema** is a data warehouse schema that contains **multiple fact tables sharing common dimension tables**. It is used to model **complex business environments** where multiple processes like sales, inventory, and shipping need to be analyzed together.

---

## One-Line Revision

> Fact Constellation = **Multiple Fact Tables + Shared Dimensions**

---

## Memory Trick

**Star Schema** → One Star
**Fact Constellation** → Many Stars (Galaxy)

---

## Final Summary

Fact Constellation is an **advanced data warehouse schema** used in **Big Data and enterprise systems** where multiple fact tables (like sales, inventory, shipping) share common dimensions (like time, product, customer). It helps organizations perform **cross-functional and deep analytics** across different business operations.
