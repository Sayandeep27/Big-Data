# Data Warehouse vs Data Lake vs Delta Lake

---

## What is Data?

Data is any raw fact such as numbers, text, images, videos, logs, or transactions that organizations collect from different sources like apps, websites, machines, sensors, or users.

Example:

* Sales records
* Customer details
* Website clicks
* CCTV images
* Machine sensor readings

---

# Why Do We Need Special Storage Systems?

As companies grow, data becomes:

* Very large (TBs and PBs)
* Comes from many sources
* In different formats (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)

Normal databases cannot handle:

* Huge volume
* Analytics workloads
* Historical data
* Multiple data formats

So modern systems were created:

1. Data Warehouse
2. Data Lake
3. Delta Lake

---

# 1. Data Warehouse

## Definition

A **Data Warehouse** is a centralized storage system that stores **clean, structured, and processed data** for reporting and business analysis.

It is mainly used by:

* Managers
* Analysts
* Business teams

Purpose: **Decision Making**

---

## Simple Real-Life Example

Imagine a supermarket chain.

Every day data comes from:

* Billing counters
* Inventory systems
* Supplier systems

Raw data is first cleaned and organized, then stored in a Data Warehouse.

Now managers can answer questions like:

* Which product sells the most?
* Which city has highest revenue?
* Monthly profit?

---

## Characteristics of Data Warehouse

* Stores **structured data** (tables)
* Data is **cleaned before storing**
* Optimized for **read and analytics**
* Historical data is stored
* Supports BI tools (Power BI, Tableau)

---

## ETL Process (Very Important)

ETL = Extract → Transform → Load

```
Sources -> Extract -> Transform (clean, format, remove errors) -> Load -> Data Warehouse
```

Example:

* Extract sales data from POS machines
* Transform currency, remove duplicates
* Load into warehouse tables

---

## Advantages

* High query performance
* Reliable and consistent data
* Best for reporting
* Good for business KPIs

---

## Disadvantages

* Expensive
* Only structured data
* Schema must be defined before storing (Schema-on-Write)

---

# 2. Data Lake

## Definition

A **Data Lake** is a storage system that stores **raw data in its original format**.

It can store:

* Structured data
* Semi-structured data (JSON, XML)
* Unstructured data (images, videos, logs)

Purpose: **Store Everything First, Analyze Later**

---

## Simple Real-Life Example

Imagine a company like Amazon.

Data comes from:

* Website clicks
* Customer reviews
* Images
* Videos
* Purchase logs

Instead of cleaning first, they store everything in a Data Lake.

Later data scientists use it for:

* Machine Learning
* Predictions
* Recommendation systems

---

## Characteristics of Data Lake

* Stores raw data
* Very cheap storage (HDFS, S3)
* Handles all formats
* Used by data engineers and data scientists
* Schema applied when reading (Schema-on-Read)

---

## Advantages

* Stores any type of data
* Very scalable
* Low cost
* Best for AI/ML projects

---

## Disadvantages

* Data can become messy (Data Swamp)
* Slower queries compared to warehouse
* No strong data quality control

---

# 3. Delta Lake

## Definition

**Delta Lake** is an advanced storage layer built on top of a Data Lake that adds:

* Reliability
* ACID transactions
* Data versioning
* Faster queries

In simple words:

**Delta Lake = Data Lake + Data Warehouse features**

---

## Why Delta Lake Was Needed?

Problems with normal Data Lake:

* Dirty data
* No transactions
* No version control
* Difficult updates and deletes

Delta Lake solves these issues.

---

## Simple Real-Life Example

Suppose a banking system stores transactions in a Data Lake.

If a transaction update fails midway:

* Data becomes inconsistent

With Delta Lake:

* Transaction either fully completes or rolls back
* Old versions are preserved

---

## Key Features

### 1. ACID Transactions

Ensures:

* No partial updates
* Data consistency

### 2. Time Travel

You can access old versions of data.

Example:

* See table as it was yesterday

### 3. Schema Enforcement

Prevents wrong data types.

### 4. Faster Queries

Uses indexing and caching.

---

## Advantages

* Reliable data lake
* Supports streaming + batch
* Handles updates and deletes
* Used in modern data engineering

---

## Disadvantages

* Requires additional setup
* Learning curve

# When Should We Use What?

## Use Data Warehouse When

* You need dashboards
* Business reporting
* Financial analysis

## Use Data Lake When

* Huge raw data
* ML projects
* Store logs, images, videos

## Use Delta Lake When

* You want data lake + reliability
* Need updates and deletes
* Building modern data platform (Lakehouse)

---

# What is Lakehouse Architecture?

Lakehouse = Data Lake + Data Warehouse

Delta Lake is commonly used to build Lakehouse systems.

Benefits:

* Single platform
* Lower cost
* High performance analytics

---

# End-to-End Data Flow Example

```
Apps / Sensors / Websites
        |
        v
     Data Lake (store raw)
        |
        v
     Delta Lake (clean + reliable)
        |
        v
     Data Warehouse (business reports)
        |
        v
     Dashboards (Power BI / Tableau)
```

---

# Final Summary

* **Data Warehouse** = Clean structured data for business decisions
* **Data Lake** = Store all raw data cheaply
* **Delta Lake** = Makes Data Lake reliable and production-ready

In modern companies, all three are often used together to build scalable data platforms.
