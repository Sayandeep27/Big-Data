# Factless Fact Table in Data Warehousing

---

## Overview

A **Factless Fact Table** is a special type of fact table in a data warehouse that **does not contain any numeric measures (facts)**.
Instead, it only stores **foreign keys** that reference dimension tables.

It is mainly used to **track events, occurrences, or relationships**.

In simple terms:

> A factless fact table answers **"Did something happen?"** rather than **"How much happened?"**

---

## Why Do We Need a Factless Fact Table?

In many real-world scenarios, we only need to know whether an event occurred or not.

Examples:

* Student attended a class
* Customer visited a store
* Employee was present on a particular day
* Product was promoted in a campaign

There is **no quantity, amount, or sales value** to store.

If we try to use a normal fact table, it will remain mostly empty.

So, we use a **Factless Fact Table**.

## Key Characteristics

| Feature                    | Description                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| No Measures                | Does not contain numeric facts like sales, profit, quantity |
| Only Keys                  | Contains only foreign keys referencing dimensions           |
| Event Tracking             | Used to track whether an event occurred                     |
| Many-to-Many Relationships | Helps represent relationships between dimensions            |
| Supports Counting          | Can be used to count occurrences using queries              |

## Types of Factless Fact Tables

### 1. Event Tracking Factless Table

Used to track whether an event happened.

Examples:

* Student attendance
* Website login
* Store visit

---

### 2. Coverage (Condition) Factless Table

Used to track what **could have happened** or what **was applicable**.

Examples:

* Products available in a store
* Students registered for a course
* Employees assigned to a department

---

## Simple Example 1: Student Attendance System

We want to track which student attended which class on which date.

There is **no numeric value** like marks or fees.

So we create a **Factless Fact Table**.

### Dimension Tables

**Student Dimension**

| Student_ID | Student_Name |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| 101        | Rahul        |
| 102        | Ananya       |

**Date Dimension**

| Date_ID | Date   |
| ------- | ------ |
| D1      | 01-Jan |
| D2      | 02-Jan |

**Class Dimension**

| Class_ID | Subject |
| -------- | ------- |
| C1       | Math    |
| C2       | Science |

---

### Factless Fact Table: Attendance_Fact

| Student_ID | Date_ID | Class_ID |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- |
| 101        | D1      | C1       |
| 102        | D1      | C1       |
| 101        | D2      | C2       |

Meaning:

* Rahul attended Math on 01-Jan
* Ananya attended Math on 01-Jan
* Rahul attended Science on 02-Jan

There is **no marks or numeric value**, only event tracking.

---

## Simple Example 2: Product Promotion Tracking

We want to track which products were promoted in which store during which time.

Again, no numeric measure is required.

### Dimensions

* Product
* Store
* Date

### Factless Fact Table: Promotion_Fact

| Product_ID | Store_ID | Date_ID |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- |
| P1         | S1       | D1      |
| P2         | S1       | D1      |
| P3         | S2       | D2      |

Meaning:

* Product P1 was promoted in Store S1 on Date D1

---

## How Do We Use It in Analysis?

Even without measures, we can perform analysis by **counting rows**.

Example Queries:

* How many students attended class today?
* How many times a product was promoted?
* How many customers visited the store?

---

## Sample SQL Query

```sql
-- Count how many students attended on a particular day
SELECT Date_ID, COUNT(*) AS Total_Attendance
FROM Attendance_Fact
GROUP BY Date_ID;
```

## Fact Table vs Factless Fact Table

| Feature             | Fact Table                   | Factless Fact Table           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Contains Measures   | Yes                          | No                            |
| Stores Numeric Data | Sales, Profit, Quantity      | None                          |
| Purpose             | Measure business performance | Track events or relationships |
| Example             | Sales Fact                   | Attendance Fact               |

## Advantages

* Helps track events clearly
* Useful for many-to-many relationships
* Supports counting-based analytics
* Simple structure
* Saves storage when no measures exist

---

## Limitations

* Cannot store numeric performance metrics
* Requires joins with dimensions for meaningful insights
* Only useful for event or coverage analysis

---

## When Should You Use a Factless Fact Table?

Use it when:

* You only need to know whether something happened
* No numeric value is available
* You want to track relationships between entities
* You need attendance, eligibility, assignment, or coverage tracking

---

## Real-World Use Cases

* Student attendance systems
* Employee presence tracking
* Hospital patient visit logs
* Website user login tracking
* Marketing campaign coverage

---

## Final Summary

A **Factless Fact Table** is used when there are **no measurable facts** but we still need to track **events or relationships** between dimensions.

It mainly stores **foreign keys** and helps answer questions like:

* Did the event happen?
* Who was involved?
* When did it happen?

It is an important concept in dimensional modeling and is widely used in real-world data warehouses.
