# MapReduce and YARN in Hadoop

---

## Introduction

Hadoop is a framework used to store and process **very large amounts of data** across multiple machines.

Two very important components of Hadoop are:

* **MapReduce** → Used for **processing data**
* **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)** → Used for **managing resources and running applications**

Both work together to make Hadoop powerful and scalable.

---

# Part 1: MapReduce

---

## What is MapReduce?

**MapReduce** is a programming model used in Hadoop to process **big data in parallel** across many computers.

It divides a big task into smaller tasks, processes them separately, and then combines the results.

### In Simple Words

MapReduce = **Divide → Process → Combine**

---

## Why Do We Need MapReduce?

When data becomes very large (GBs, TBs, PBs), a single computer:

* Becomes slow
* Cannot handle processing
* May run out of memory

MapReduce solves this by:

* Splitting data across multiple machines
* Processing data in parallel
* Giving faster results

---

## Real Life Example (Word Count)

Suppose you have **1 TB of text files** and you want to count how many times each word appears.

Without MapReduce:

* One computer reads all files
* Takes huge time

With MapReduce:

* Data is split across many machines
* Each machine counts words in its part
* Results are combined

---

## How MapReduce Works (Step by Step)

### 1. Input Split

Large data is divided into smaller blocks.

Example:

1 TB data → Split into 128 MB blocks

---

### 2. Map Phase

Each machine processes its block and produces key–value pairs.

Example (Word Count):

```
Input:
"big data is big"

Mapper Output:
(big,1)
(data,1)
(is,1)
(big,1)
```

---

### 3. Shuffle and Sort

Hadoop groups the same keys together.

```
(big,1) (big,1) → (big,[1,1])
(data,1) → (data,[1])
```

---

### 4. Reduce Phase

Reducer combines values and produces final result.

```
(big,2)
(data,1)
(is,1)
```

## MapReduce Architecture

### Main Components

| Component  | Role                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Job Client | Submits the job         |
| Mapper     | Processes input data    |
| Reducer    | Aggregates results      |
| HDFS       | Stores input and output |

---

## Key Features of MapReduce

* Parallel processing
* Fault tolerance
* Scalable
* Works on commodity hardware
* Handles very large datasets

---

## Advantages of MapReduce

* Processes TBs and PBs of data
* Automatic data distribution
* Fault tolerant
* Cost effective

---

## Limitations of MapReduce

* Slow for real-time processing
* Not suitable for iterative algorithms
* High latency
* Complex debugging

---

# Part 2: YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)

---

## What is YARN?

**YARN** is the resource management layer of Hadoop.

It decides:

* Which machine will run which task
* How much CPU and memory is allocated
* When tasks should run

### In Simple Words

YARN = **Cluster Resource Manager**

---

## Why Was YARN Introduced?

Earlier Hadoop (Hadoop 1.x):

* MapReduce handled both processing and resource management
* This created bottlenecks

Hadoop 2.x introduced YARN to:

* Separate resource management
* Improve performance
* Allow multiple processing engines (Spark, Tez, etc.)

---

## Real Life Example (Office Manager)

Imagine an office:

* Employees = Machines
* Manager = YARN

Manager decides:

* Who will do which task
* How many resources each gets
* Ensures no one is overloaded

---

## YARN Architecture

### Main Components

| Component         | Role                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ResourceManager   | Manages cluster resources              |
| NodeManager       | Manages resources on each machine      |
| ApplicationMaster | Manages a specific application         |
| Container         | Bundle of CPU + Memory where task runs |

---

## How YARN Works (Step by Step)

1. User submits job
2. ResourceManager receives request
3. ResourceManager allocates container
4. ApplicationMaster starts
5. Tasks run on NodeManagers
6. Results returned to user

---

## Key Features of YARN

* Dynamic resource allocation
* Supports multiple engines (MapReduce, Spark, Tez)
* Better cluster utilization
* Scalable

---

## Advantages of YARN

* Efficient resource management
* Runs multiple applications
* Improves cluster performance
* Supports big data ecosystem tools

---

## MapReduce vs YARN

| Feature                  | MapReduce             | YARN                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Type                     | Data Processing Model | Resource Management Framework    |
| Main Work                | Processes data        | Manages cluster resources        |
| Introduced In            | Hadoop 1.x            | Hadoop 2.x                       |
| Responsibility           | Mapping & Reducing    | Scheduling & Resource Allocation |
| Can Run Multiple Engines | No                    | Yes                              |

---

## How MapReduce and YARN Work Together

* MapReduce is the **processing engine**
* YARN is the **resource manager**

Flow:

1. User submits MapReduce job
2. YARN allocates resources
3. MapReduce processes data
4. Output stored in HDFS

---

## Final Summary

* **MapReduce** processes large data by dividing tasks and combining results.
* **YARN** manages cluster resources and schedules jobs.
* Together they make Hadoop capable of handling **big data at massive scale**.
