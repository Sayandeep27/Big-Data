## 1. Introduction

In **Data Warehousing** and **Business Intelligence (BI)** systems, organizations store large amounts of data to analyze business performance.

To make analysis faster and easier for specific departments, companies create **Data Marts**.

Inside a data mart (or data warehouse), data is mainly organized into:

* **Fact Tables** (numerical, measurable data)
* **Dimension Tables** (descriptive information)

These concepts are the **foundation of data modeling** in analytics systems.

## 2. What is a Data Mart?

A **Data Mart** is a **subset of a Data Warehouse** that is focused on a **specific department, business function, or use case**.

It contains only the data that a particular team needs.

### Simple Definition

A **Data Mart** is a smaller, department-specific version of a data warehouse.

### Why Data Marts are Used

* Faster query performance
* Easier access for business teams
* Reduced data complexity
* Department-level decision making

### Examples

| Department | Data Mart Contains                     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Sales      | Sales transactions, revenue, customers |
| Finance    | Expenses, profit, budgets              |
| HR         | Employee details, salary, attendance   |
| Marketing  | Campaign performance, leads            |

## 3. Types of Data Marts

### 1. Dependent Data Mart

Created from an existing **Data Warehouse**.

**Example:**
Sales data mart created from enterprise warehouse.

### 2. Independent Data Mart

Created directly from operational systems without a central warehouse.

**Example:**
HR team creates its own reporting database.

### 3. Hybrid Data Mart

Combination of both dependent and independent sources.

## 4. Data Mart vs Data Warehouse

| Feature     | Data Warehouse               | Data Mart           |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Scope       | Enterprise-wide              | Department-specific |
| Size        | Very large                   | Smaller             |
| Users       | Entire organization          | Specific team       |
| Complexity  | High                         | Lower               |
| Cost        | Expensive                    | Cheaper             |
| Performance | Slower compared to data mart | Faster queries      |

## 5. What is a Fact Table?

A **Fact Table** contains **quantitative (numeric) data** used for analysis.

It stores **measurable business events**.

### Key Points

* Contains numbers (measures)
* Connected to dimension tables
* Usually very large
* Used for calculations and KPIs

### Examples of Facts

* Sales amount
* Quantity sold
* Profit
* Discount

### Typical Columns in Fact Table

| Column       | Description               |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Foreign Keys | Links to dimension tables |
| Measures     | Numeric values            |
| Date Key     | Time reference            |

---

## 6. Types of Facts

### Additive Facts

Can be summed across all dimensions.

**Example:** Sales amount

### Semi-Additive Facts

Can be summed across some dimensions only.

**Example:** Account balance

### Non-Additive Facts

Cannot be summed.

**Example:** Percentage, ratios

---

## 7. What is a Dimension Table?

A **Dimension Table** contains **descriptive information** about the business.

It provides context to the numbers stored in fact tables.

### Simple Definition

Dimension table = **"Who, What, Where, When, How"** details.

### Examples

* Customer details
* Product information
* Store location
* Time (date, month, year)

### Typical Columns in Dimension Table

| Column      | Description        |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Primary Key | Unique identifier  |
| Attributes  | Descriptive fields |

---

## 8. Characteristics of Dimension Tables

* Contain text or categorical data
* Smaller than fact tables
* Used for filtering and grouping
* Denormalized structure (often)
* Used in reports and dashboards

---

## 9. Fact Table vs Dimension Table

| Feature   | Fact Table   | Dimension Table      |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| Data Type | Numeric      | Descriptive          |
| Purpose   | Measurement  | Context              |
| Size      | Large        | Smaller              |
| Keys      | Foreign keys | Primary keys         |
| Usage     | Aggregation  | Filtering & grouping |
| Example   | Sales amount | Customer name        |

## 10. Star Schema Example

In a **Star Schema**, one fact table is connected to multiple dimension tables.

```
            Customer Dim
                 |
Product Dim ——— Sales Fact ——— Time Dim
                 |
              Store Dim
```

This structure improves query performance for analytics.

## 11. Real World Example (Retail Business)

### Fact Table: Sales_Fact

| Date_Key | Product_Key | Customer_Key | Store_Key | Quantity | Sales_Amount |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------ | --------- | -------- | ------------ |
| 101      | 501         | 1001         | 21        | 2        | 500          |

### Dimension Tables

**Customer_Dim**

| Customer_Key | Customer_Name | City  |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----- |
| 1001         | Rahul         | Delhi |

**Product_Dim**

| Product_Key | Product_Name | Category    |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 501         | Laptop       | Electronics |
