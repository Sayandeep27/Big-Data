# 3-Tier Data Warehouse Architecture

---

## Overview

**3-Tier Data Warehouse Architecture** is a structured design used in data warehousing to organize how data is stored, processed, and accessed for analysis and reporting.

It divides the entire data warehouse system into **three logical layers (tiers)**:

1. **Bottom Tier – Data Storage Layer**
2. **Middle Tier – OLAP Server (Processing Layer)**
3. **Top Tier – Frontend Tools (Presentation Layer)**

This separation improves **performance, scalability, security, and manageability**.

---

## Why 3-Tier Architecture is Used

| Reason             | Explanation                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Better Performance | Processing is separated from storage and presentation |
| Scalability        | Each layer can be scaled independently                |
| Security           | Controlled access between layers                      |
| Easy Maintenance   | Changes in one layer do not affect others much        |
| Faster Analysis    | Optimized OLAP layer for queries                      |

# Tier 1: Bottom Tier (Data Storage Layer)

---

## Definition

The **Bottom Tier** is the **data warehouse database layer** where all cleaned, integrated, and historical data is stored.

It collects data from multiple sources using **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes.

---

## Main Responsibilities

* Collect data from multiple sources
* Clean and transform data
* Integrate data into a unified format
* Store historical data
* Maintain fact and dimension tables

---

## Data Sources

Examples:

* ERP Systems
* CRM Systems
* Excel Files
* Transaction Databases
* IoT Data
* Logs

---

## Components of Bottom Tier

| Component               | Purpose                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Data Warehouse Database | Stores structured historical data        |
| Data Marts              | Department-specific subset of data       |
| ETL Tools               | Extract, clean, transform, and load data |
| Staging Area            | Temporary storage before loading         |

---

## Technologies Used

Examples:

* Amazon Redshift
* Google BigQuery
* Snowflake
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Oracle
* Hadoop HDFS

---

## Simple Example

A retail company collects data from:

* Billing software
* Online website
* Inventory system

ETL processes clean and store this data into a central **Data Warehouse**.

---

# Tier 2: Middle Tier (OLAP Server – Processing Layer)

---

## Definition

The **Middle Tier** contains the **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) Server** which processes data for fast analytical queries.

It acts as a bridge between the database and user tools.

---

## Main Responsibilities

* Perform complex analytical queries
* Aggregate data
* Create multidimensional views (cubes)
* Provide fast query performance
* Handle business calculations

---

## Types of OLAP Servers

| Type  | Full Form             | Description                    |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ROLAP | Relational OLAP       | Uses relational databases      |
| MOLAP | Multidimensional OLAP | Uses cube-based storage        |
| HOLAP | Hybrid OLAP           | Combination of ROLAP and MOLAP |

---

## Key Features

* Slice
* Dice
* Drill Down
* Roll Up
* Pivot

These operations help users analyze data from multiple dimensions.

---

## Technologies Used

Examples:

* Microsoft SSAS
* SAP BW
* Oracle OLAP
* Apache Kylin
* Mondrian

---

## Simple Example

A sales manager wants:

* Total sales by year
* Sales by region
* Sales by product category

The OLAP server quickly aggregates and provides this information.

---

# Tier 3: Top Tier (Frontend Tools – Presentation Layer)

---

## Definition

The **Top Tier** contains **user interface tools** that allow users to access, analyze, visualize, and generate reports from the data warehouse.

---

## Main Responsibilities

* Reporting
* Dashboard creation
* Data visualization
* Ad-hoc queries
* Business analysis

---

## Types of Frontend Tools

| Type              | Purpose                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| Reporting Tools   | Generate formatted reports |
| Dashboard Tools   | Visual monitoring          |
| Data Mining Tools | Discover patterns          |
| Query Tools       | Run custom queries         |

---

## Technologies Used

Examples:

* Power BI
* Tableau
* QlikView
* Looker
* Excel

---

## Simple Example

A CEO views:

* Monthly revenue dashboard
* Profit trends
* Region-wise performance charts

These are created using frontend BI tools.
