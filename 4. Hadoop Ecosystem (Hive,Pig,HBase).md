# Hadoop Ecosystem (Hive, Pig, HBase)

---

## What is Hadoop Ecosystem?

The **Hadoop Ecosystem** is a collection of tools and technologies built around **Apache Hadoop** that help in storing, processing, managing, and analyzing **Big Data**.

Hadoop alone provides:

* **HDFS** → Storage
* **MapReduce** → Processing

But working directly with MapReduce is difficult.

So, the Hadoop Ecosystem provides higher-level tools like:

* **Hive**
* **Pig**
* **HBase**

These tools make big data processing **easier, faster, and more user-friendly**.

---

# Why Do We Need Hadoop Ecosystem Tools?

Imagine you have **huge data** like:

* Facebook posts
* YouTube logs
* Banking transactions
* E-commerce orders

Writing MapReduce code for everything is:

* Complex
* Time-consuming
* Not suitable for analysts

So Hadoop Ecosystem tools:

* Reduce coding effort
* Provide SQL-like or scripting interface
* Make data analysis easy

# Hadoop Ecosystem Overview

| Tool      | Purpose                       | Used By                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Hive**  | SQL-based data analysis       | Data Analysts                    |
| **Pig**   | Scripting for data processing | Data Engineers                   |
| **HBase** | Real-time NoSQL database      | Applications needing fast access |

# Apache Hive

## What is Hive?

**Apache Hive** is a **data warehouse tool** built on top of Hadoop.

It allows users to write **SQL-like queries** (called **HiveQL**) instead of complex MapReduce programs.

---

## Why Hive?

Because many people know SQL but not Java/MapReduce.

Hive converts SQL queries into MapReduce jobs internally.

---

## How Hive Works (Simple Flow)

1. Data stored in **HDFS**
2. User writes **SQL query**
3. Hive converts it to **MapReduce/Spark job**
4. Result is returned

---

## Example

### Problem

We have an **e-commerce dataset** and want to find total sales.

### Hive Query

```sql
SELECT SUM(amount)
FROM orders;
```

Without Hive → Need complex MapReduce code

With Hive → Just SQL query

---

## When to Use Hive?

* Batch processing
* Data warehousing
* Reporting
* Large-scale analytics

---

# Apache Pig

## What is Pig?

**Apache Pig** is a **high-level scripting platform** used for processing large datasets.

It uses a language called **Pig Latin**.

Pig Latin is easier than writing MapReduce in Java.

---

## Why Pig?

Because data engineers need:

* Data cleaning
* Data transformation
* ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

Pig simplifies these tasks.

---

## How Pig Works (Simple Flow)

1. Data stored in **HDFS**
2. Write **Pig script**
3. Pig converts it into **MapReduce job**
4. Output generated

---

## Example

### Problem

Count number of orders per city.

### Pig Script

```pig
orders = LOAD 'orders.csv' USING PigStorage(',')
AS (id:int, city:chararray, amount:int);

city_group = GROUP orders BY city;

result = FOREACH city_group GENERATE group, COUNT(orders);

DUMP result;
```

---

## When to Use Pig?

* Data preprocessing
* Log processing
* ETL pipelines
* Large-scale transformations

---

# Apache HBase

## What is HBase?

**Apache HBase** is a **NoSQL distributed database** built on top of Hadoop.

It is designed for **real-time read and write** access to big data.

---

## Why HBase?

HDFS is good for storage but:

* Not suitable for fast updates
* Not good for random reads/writes

HBase solves this problem.

---

## Key Features

* Column-oriented database
* Distributed
* Scalable
* Supports real-time operations

---

## Example

### Use Case

Banking system storing customer transactions.

We need:

* Fast lookup of a customer
* Frequent updates

HBase table example:

| Row Key | Name  | Balance | Last Transaction |
| ------- | ----- | ------- | ---------------- |
| 101     | Rahul | 50,000  | 02-Jan           |
| 102     | Priya | 75,000  | 05-Jan           |

Applications can quickly read/update rows.

---

## When to Use HBase?

* Real-time applications
* Online systems
* Time-series data
* IoT data

# Hive vs Pig vs HBase

| Feature    | Hive           | Pig                  | HBase          |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| Type       | Data Warehouse | Data Processing Tool | NoSQL Database |
| Language   | SQL (HiveQL)   | Pig Latin            | API/Commands   |
| Processing | Batch          | Batch                | Real-time      |
| Best For   | Analysts       | Data Engineers       | Applications   |
| Runs On    | Hadoop         | Hadoop               | Hadoop         |

# Real-World Scenario (End-to-End Example)

## E-commerce Company

### Step 1: Store Data

* User clicks
* Orders
* Logs

Stored in **HDFS**.

---

### Step 2: Data Cleaning

Use **Pig** to:

* Remove invalid records
* Transform data

---

### Step 3: Data Analysis

Use **Hive** to:

* Find total revenue
* Monthly sales report

---

### Step 4: Real-Time Access

Use **HBase** to:

* Show user purchase history instantly
* Update cart data

---

# Final Summary

* **Hive** → SQL-based analytics tool
* **Pig** → Data processing and ETL scripting tool
* **HBase** → Real-time NoSQL database

Together, they make Hadoop powerful for handling **Big Data storage, processing, analytics, and real-time access**.

---

**In Short:**

* Hive = SQL on Hadoop
* Pig = Data processing scripting
* HBase = Real-time big data database
